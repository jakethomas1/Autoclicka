# Autoclicka

autoclicker.py is a python3 script which uses tkinter and pynput to create a minimalist customizable rapid automatic clicking application (i.e. autoclicker).  
<br/>

*Note: This can be run on Linux however running on Windows requires the least steps. These instructions are tailored for Windows.*

## Instructions:

1. **First acquire dependencies 'tkinter' and 'pynput':**  

   - **'tkinter'**  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should be installed by default on Windows.  

   - **'pynput'**  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open PowerShell in Windows.  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the following command in PowerShell:  
     ```powershell
     pip install pynput  # May use pip3 depending on your Windows python alias.
     ```

2. **Run the script:**  

   - Navigate in PowerShell so that the script is in your working directory.  
   - Use the following command in PowerShell:  
     ```powershell
     python autoclicker.py
     ```

### Output:
A graphical user interface should appear with 5 buttons, adjusting the click speed and the activation duration. The Start button should activate automatic clicking after a short delay.
